## üöÄ Key Features

* **Multi-language Support:** The portfolio dynamically loads content in either Portuguese or English based on user selection or browser preference. Text content is stored in `JSON` files (`lang/en.json` and `lang/pt.json`).
* **Dark/Light Theme:** Users can toggle between a dark and a light theme, and their preference is saved in local storage for future visits.
* **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.
* **Interactive Modals:** Clicking on a skill or course opens a modal window with a detailed description.
* **Smooth Scrolling & Animations:** The portfolio uses smooth scrolling for internal links and subtle animations that trigger on scroll to enhance the user experience.
